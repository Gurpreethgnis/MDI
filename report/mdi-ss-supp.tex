\section{Bayesian hyperparameter optimization}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

The goal of Bayesian optimization is to choose a point in the hyperparameter space that appropriately balances information gain and exploitation. Figure \ref{fig:params} shows the exploration of hyperparameter space during Bayesian optimization for both Adult and CVRs datasets. Each circle represents a candidate neural network classifier trained on a differently imputed and perturbed dataset. More circles appear in the plot for CVRs simply due to the fact that the training set is smaller. We see that most of the candidate models use dropout and have an initial learning rate close to the maximum of 0.01. The plurality of candidate models appear to either have momentum (1) or not (0).
