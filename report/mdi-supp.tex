\section{Bayesian hyperparameter optimization}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

The goal of Bayesian optimization is to choose a point in the hyperparameter space that appropriately balances information gain and exploitation. Figure \ref{fig:params} shows the exploration of hyperparameter space during Bayesian optimization for both Adult and CVRs datasets. Each circle represents a candidate ANNs classifier trained on a differently imputed and perturbed dataset. More circles appear in the plot for CVRs simply due to the fact that the training set is smaller. We see that most of the candidate models use dropout and have an initial learning rate close to the maximum of 0.01. The plurality of candidate models appear to either have momentum (1) or not (0).

\section{Results with MNAR perturbation}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

In order to study the effect of larger amounts of missing data, we perturb the training data so that each categorical feature has 10\%, 20\%, 30\%, and 40\% values missing according to the MNAR mechanism
 
 \begin{equation}\label{3.1}
\Pr (M_i = 1 | y_i, \phi) = \begin{cases}
1, &\text{if $y_i \in A$}  \\
0, &\text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\end{equation} where $A$ is a vector containing at least one value from each categorical feature that we determine likely to be missing. We select categorical values in the Adult dataset that are theoretically correlated with low socioeconomic status, such as the values ``Without pay'' and ``Never worked" for the feature \emph{Work class}. The existing literature suggests item nonresponse in surveys is correlated with low income and low education (Rubin et al., 1995). We include in $A$ only ``nay'' votes, under the assumption that refusing to take position on an issue or missing a vote is akin to voting against the issue.
